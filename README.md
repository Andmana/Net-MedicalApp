# NetMedical Web App

This project was developed by a team of three developers as part of a bootcamp assignment. The goal was to create a functional medical web application.

## My Responsibilities

As a part of the development team, I was responsible for implementing the following features:

- **Password Reset Functionality**: I developed the functionality to allow users to reset their password securely if they forget it.
- **Role Management**: I added different user roles (admin, customer, staff) and defined the necessary functionality for each role.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: I implemented role-based access to restrict which sections and features users could access based on their assigned roles.
- **Medicine List and Cart Display**: I worked on displaying the list of medicines available on the platform and the shopping cart functionality, allowing users to add, remove, and manage items before checkout.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, .Net MVC
- **Backend**: .Net Web API
- **Database**: Ms SQL Server
